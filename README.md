Basic demo of microservices

To get the code and run the program, do a git pull & dotnet run.  Then use Swagger to test the endpoints.

This is a basic demo of a single hypothetical microservice that runs a game catalog service where the products are stored in an "Items" collection.
This microservice uses a MongoDB running in a Docker container.
